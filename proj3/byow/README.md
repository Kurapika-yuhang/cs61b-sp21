## 1. Classes and data structures

## 2. Algorithms
## 3. Persistence


## phase 1 Requirements
* The world must be a 2D grid, drawn using our tile engine. The tile engine is described in lab12.

* The world must be pseudorandomly generated. Pseudorandomness is discussed in lab 12.

* The generated world must include distinct rooms and hallways, though it may also include outdoor spaces.

* At least some rooms should be rectangular, though you may support other shapes as well.

* Your world generator must be capable of generating hallways that include turns (or equivalently, straight hallways that intersect).

* The world should contain a random number of rooms and hallways.

* The locations of the rooms and hallways should be random.

* The width and height of rooms should be random.

* Hallways should have a width of 1 or 2 tiles and a random length.

* Rooms and hallways must have walls that are visually distinct from floors. Walls and floors should be visually distinct from unused spaces.

* Rooms and hallways should be connected, i.e. there should not be gaps in the floor between adjacent rooms or hallways.

* All rooms should be reachable, i.e. there should be no rooms with no way to enter

* The world should be substantially different each time, i.e. you should not have the same basic layout with easily predictable features
